# Install Open Source Event Manager
All the information that you need to install OSEM. If you have any problems with installing don't hesitate to [contact us](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem#contact)

## Versions
OSEM is an [semantic versioned](http://semver.org/) app. That means given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH we increment the:

1. MAJOR version when we make incompatible changes,
2. MINOR version when we add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
3. PATCH version when we make backwards-compatible bug fixes

## Download
You can find the latest OSEM releases on our [release page](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/releases/latest) ([older release here](https://github.com/openSUSE/osem/releases))

## Deploy
OSEM is a *Ruby on Rails* application. We recommend to run OSEM in production with [mod_passenger](https://www.phusionpassenger.com/download/#open_source)
and the [apache web-server](https://www.apache.org/). There are tons of guides on how to deploy rails apps on various
base operating systems. [Check Google](https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&q=ruby%20on%20rails%20apache%20passenger) ;-)

For more information about rails and what it can do, see the [rails guides.](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

## Dependencies

### ImageMagick
We use [ImageMagick](http://imagemagick.org/) for image manipulation so it needs to be available in your installation.
If you would like to resize exisiting logos in your OSEM installation you can do so by running the following rake task:

```shell
$ bundle exec rake logo:reprocess
```

### openID
In order to use [openID](http://openid.net/) logins for your OSEM installation you need to register your application with the providers ([Google](https://code.google.com/apis/console#:access), [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) or [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)) and enter their API keys in `config/secrets.yml` file, changing the existing sample values.

## Recurring Jobs
